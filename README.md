# TheTeamTrackerMobile

This application was built using Xamarin. You will need to have .NET and Xamarin SDK installed (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/installation/?pivots=windows). 

The API (https://github.com/pjmttt/the-team-tracker-api) will need to be deployed somewhere for this application to talk to. In the subfolder TheTeamTracker.Mobile create a file named config.json (use sample for reference) to point to the API URL.
